# Ecommerce-Project-Myntra-
Welcome to the manual testing project for ecommerce platform!

This project aims to ensure the quality and functionality of our platform by manually testing various features and user flows. This includes testing the checkout process, product page functionality, and the overall user experience on different devices and browsers.

To get started, you will need to have a test account set up on the platform to test on.

Our manual testing process follows the following steps:

Define the scope of the testing: This includes identifying which features and user flows will be tested.

Write test cases: Test cases outline the specific actions and expected outcomes for each feature being tested. These should be detailed and cover a variety of scenarios to ensure thorough testing.

Execute test cases: Following the steps outlined in the test cases, manually test each feature. Document any issues or bugs that are encountered.
